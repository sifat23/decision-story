Pierre & Matilde. Their story is one that makes you believe in soul mates…two people brought together by a common language and a little bit of fate… an instant connection and understanding, that has only strengthened with time. Our Creative Director first met this charming couple at a craft fair in Echo Park, and spoke of how open and warm they were.  Matilde is from Belgium, and when she met Pierre, he spoke french and they instantly connected.  Pierre describes Matilde as his muse, and he has decorated their apartment with gorgeous photos he has taken of her.  And Matilde… she is one of those unique beauties who stops you in your tracks with her stunning looks and impeccable, slightly European style.  Cut to later on, our Creative Director was sitting at a stop light and heard someone honk their horn.  She looked up to see Pierre & Matilde, and knew that their love story had to be told!

Thank you, Pierre & Matilde, for welcoming us into your home and hearts.
