When I was 18 my dad was outed as a serial cheater and my mother fashioned into a martyr of a cast many generations out of date. This took all of two minutes when she called me at boarding school to say that he was leaving. And he�d already siphoned off money to buy a house on the other side of the tracks in our tiny Montana town. I hung up the phone feeling marked. I wished like a hermit crab I could shed this tacky suffocating shell for something placid and pink with smooth edges.    I don�t remember crying. I do remember sitting down and writing an email to my best friend a very serious Quaker and a virgin like myself a letter of which I remember nothing but she�s assured me it was in caps lock thousands of words long and began: �MY LIFE HAS TAKEN A BAROQUE AND GARISH TURN.� Baroque was a word I learned not in my AP art history class but AP English where it was more clearly defined: �A disinherited American girl learns that men are monsters and finds herself shored up on an unfamiliar moral plane as flimsy as a communion wafer.�    Four years later my Barnard therapist�a towering bald man with a single earring in his right ear and an office inside a private gym�suggested that I hated my father more than my siblings hated him because as a writer I was sensitive to the fact that he�d ruined all my stories. It was the revelation I had been paying him for. I did hate my dad for marring my childhood memories He was like a massive oil spill polluting the bluest ocean in the world. Like the time my mother drove us 15 hours each way screaming and sticky to stay at my grandparents� century farm in South Dakota which turned out to be a huge ruse so that we could come home to a brandnew tree house in the yard Built by my dad I immediately got stuck so much so that he had to nail extra steps into the tree while I sobbed facedown on the plywood floor refusing to even peek out the trapdoor whereas my sister just jumped and broke her arm.    �It isn�t the same story� I whined to my therapist. �Because he was actually with his painter mistress the first time I got to drive the combine and dropped that popsicle in my lap�    Bald therapist spent years gently encouraging me to share positive stories about my father with my friends without castrating him. I will tell you the only story about my father that I like my favorite story of prelapsarian bliss in the whole world    It was 1986 the middle of July in the high country. My mother�a tan 5foot5 with curly black hair cascading out of her head every which way�was bundled in a rustcolor Patagonia puffer cagoule and Norwegian sweater combo furiously throwing wood on the fire. A snowstorm was whipping up and slamming into doubleplated windows at a packitinpackitout backcountry chalet on the Continental Divide. All the lights and the oven run on temperamentally dangerous propane. There�s no road. My mother�a native South Dakotan who drove across the country after graduate school answering help wanted ads in newspapers in towns she liked�had ended up managing this quasibedandbreakfast populated mainly by hikers hearty enough to struggle seven miles to sleep on a ratty mattress and listen to their neighbors have sex through paperthin walls. She insisted only that the place hire an allwomen crew. This was her 10th season; she�d seen it all which might explain why she was single.    The park service had sent a fire lookout over to issue a warning against leaving. My mother was becoming increasingly wary of the stircrazy shoptalk from a group of 40yearold guys who were three trail beers away from skiing down the mountain to their deaths. This literally entails crossing a treecovered area so loved by wild animals they call it �bear valley.� She once told me there�s more to fear from men than the elements. Perhaps that�s why she proposed a plan to detain them: a chaletwide country luau�themed song competition. The winner got a huckleberry pie baked by my mother. It was the sort of fully baked plan that would only occur to an associate pastor in charge of youth programming which is what she was in the offseason.    My father was one of these problematic guests at the chalet. He was at this time either a projectionist at the first �truly independent� movie theater in Helena Montana or a bus driver for the public schools. True to his personality he was mostly just keen on entertaining his newfound audience and my mother in particular. His friend Rick�a thinlipped geologist who would become my brother�s godfather�had handily strapped a banjo to his backpack and my father spent the afternoon ripping down all the floral curtains fashioning local Hawaiian garb and penning an ode to the �Chaladies of Granite Park� with special focus on their intrepid leader. That the singers were all over six feet and the curtains were dainty did not daunt my father who to his credit is still a classA entertainer of women. He insisted for �authenticity purposes� that no one wear any other clothes. My mother thought he was �funny.� He ate the pie straight from the tin with a fork . . .    It�s hard to elucidate how weird it was that my father�a wayward atheist the �same height as Lincoln� who worked only to save enough money to go sell blue jeans in Berlin�pairbonded with a plucky woman half his size with a yen for the kind community organizing that translates well to coordinating children�s doctors appointments. My dad used to say it didn�t matter because they were in love. In fact he was in love and spent the entire summer sending her pages upon pages of letters all of which just said I love you at the top and the bottom and had them transported by mule from the trailhead explaining how they should spend the rest of their lives together starting with him going to law school which is to be fair a promise he kept.    They were married six months later having never so much as lived in the same city.    When I turned 26 a nononsense lawyer pointedly gave me a children�s book called Are You My Boyfriend? A cartoon blonde in pigtails leaves her house and approaches a series of men and breathlessly asks them all �Are you my boyfriend? Are you my boyfriend?� Pieeyed at first she gets more and more disheartened as she downcycles through male archetypes facing rejection from the tough guy the rich cad and the average guy. Had I written this book she would have walked around her living room questioning inanimate objects like a cuckoo clock or a salt shaker shaped like a turkey. �Are we involved?� Or I�d have set it outside where any number of male specimens might have the free time to gaslight her into thinking they shared a sexual history.    When I received this children�s book I was �writing� in Los Angeles for two months where I was �involved� with the keyboardist in Sting�s daughter�s band who I�d met peeing in a parking lot behind a gallery; a married television writer who I met at the house party of an actor from Girls the actor tried to physically restrain me from going home with the writer telling me to �stop ruining lives�; and the writer of some �90s films who used to be married to a thin sophisticated friend of my mentor.    No one in the five years I�d been sexually active had said �This is my girlfriend� But I didn�t care I saw all the time I spent downtown in New York amassing formative sexual experiences as a weedingout process that would stop the second I met someone worth marrying. I was hoping my most formative experience�the one where I lost my virginity to a plumber in an open relationship in Montana�wasn�t a harbinger.    I flew back to New York in the fall looking for a fresh start and a poster for my apartment. �There�s nothing like New York in the fall� I DM�d an Internet stranger this guy who designed the posters for the 2003 film The Brown Bunny. I wanted the one of the blow job scene to give my apartment a NSFW vibe and explained how I couldn�t pay for it but . . . I loved his work He agreed to give me his last copy for free as long as I met him in �a public place.� I w
