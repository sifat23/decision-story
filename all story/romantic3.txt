Anger and Love – Emotional Mistake
Anger and Love - Emotional MistakeWhile a man was polishing his new car, his 6 yr old son picked up a stone and scratched lines on the side of the car. In anger, the man took the child’s hand and hit it many times; not realizing he was using a wrench.

At the hospital, the child lost all his fingers due to multiple fractures. When the child saw his father…..with painful eyes he asked, ‘Dad when will my fingers grow back?’ The man was so hurt and speechless; he went back to his car and kicked it a lot of times. Devastated by his own actions…….sitting in front of that car he looked at the scratches; the child had written
‘LOVE YOU DAD’.

Anger and Love have no limits; choose the latter to have a beautiful, lovely life….. Things are to be used and people are to be loved. But the problem in today’s world is that, People are used and things are loved….Let’s be careful to keep this thought in mind: Things are to be used, but People are to be loved.

Watch your thoughts; they become words. Watch your words; they become actions. Watch your actions; they become habits. Watch your habits they become character;Watch your character; it becomes your destiny.

I’m glad a friend forwarded this to me as a reminder. God bless you. If you don’t share this on nothing bad will happen; if you do, you might change someones life
